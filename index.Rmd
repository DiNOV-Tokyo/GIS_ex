## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(mapview)
library(leaflet)
library(leafpop)
library(lattice)
library(sp)

data(meuse)
coordinates(meuse) <- ~x+y
proj4string(meuse) <- CRS("+init=epsg:28992")

p <- xyplot(copper ~ cadmium, data = meuse@data, col = "grey", pch = 20, cex = 2)
p <- mget(rep("p", length(meuse)))

clr <- rep("grey", length(meuse))
p <- lapply(1:length(p), function(i) {
  clr[i] <- "red"
  update(p[[i]], col = clr)
})


mapview(meuse,
        zcol = "cadmium",
        popup = popupGraph(p))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
